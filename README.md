# Calculation of KI and GI utilsing FEA |(VCCT and MVVCT)
In this repository, KI and GI as critical parameters in investigating frcture of materials for a E-glass fiber reinforced - Al composite with an initial 20 mm crack have been calculated. The investigatd methods are as below:

## KI and GI Calculation using FEM
- Stress based method using normal elements
- Displacement based method using normal elements
- kI calculation using crack tip elements
- GI calculation using VCCT method


## Input Data

The part configuration and material property are presented in Figure 1.

## Mesh Study and Crack Tip Elements
Meticulous meshing with enhanced density around the crack tip ensures precise resolution, as depicted in Figure 2, with crack tip elements measuring 0.1 mm for accuracy.
